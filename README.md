# Increasing Item Drops
Every time you mine a block, the number of item drops increase by 1!

In this Spigot Plugin, every **single** time you mine a block, the amount of item drops increase by one!

View the plugin on SpigotMC.org: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/increasing-item-drops.89676/

**Don't get it?**

Let's say you load this plugin and get into a brand new world!
You mine one grass block and you get a single dirt block back.
Boring... right?
Try again!

If you mine it again, you will get **TWO** dirt blocks back, making the number of dirt blocks in your inventory 3.
Mine it again, you will get three dirt blocks.

As you can see, every single time you mine a block; any block in fact, you will get the previous number of drops, but by one more!
